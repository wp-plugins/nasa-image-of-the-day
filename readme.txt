Adds a sidebar widget to display the current image from the NASA 
Image Of The Day Gallery.

== Description ==

NASA makes a new Image Of The Day available every day in their gallery, 
complete with a fairly detailed description of what you see. This plugin
grabs a thumbnail of the current image along with an extract of the
accompanying description, and makes it available as a WordPress sidebar 
widget. Clicking on the thumbnail will take you to the NASA Gallery where
you can view the full sized image and read the rest of the text. No
local storage is used, the image and text is fetched on every view.

The image and text is fetched by parsing the HTML code of the relevant 
web page at NASA, so if they make more than cosmetic changes the widget
will break. Hopefully gracefully, showing a sorry-text instead. Look for
updates if that happens.
